Quickly made a setup in Laravel so you get an idea what the game would've been.

To run use:

php artisan serve

script.js has all game functions.

When I made the game it had also had used sql in their framework
It was dynamic in that way in you could see the 5 players with the best time, 
but can't use that in this code.
